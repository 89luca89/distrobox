# Install Distrobox on the Steamdeck

To install Distrobox on the steamdeck, we can install both `podman` and `distrobox`
inside the `$HOME` so that containers will survive updates.

## Install Podman

To install podman, [refer to the install guide](install_podman_static.md#):

- Download the latest release of `podman-launcher` and place it in your home and rename it to `podman`,
  this example will use `~/.local/bin`
- Make the `podman` binary executable:
  - `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/podman`
- Setup `deck` user password using:
  - `passwd`
- Setup `deck` user uidmap:
  - `sudo touch /etc/subuid /etc/subgid`
  - `sudo usermod --add-subuid 100000-165535 --add-subgid 100000-165535 deck`

And `podman` is ready to use!

### Alternative Install Lilipod

To install podman, [refer to the install guide](install_lilipod_static.md#):

- Download the latest release of `podman-launcher` and place it in your home and rename it to `podman`,
  this example will use `~/.local/bin`
- Setup `deck` user password using:
  - `passwd`
- Setup `deck` user uidmap:
  - `sudo touch /etc/subuid /etc/subgid`
  - `sudo usermod --add-subuid 100000-165535 --add-subgid 100000-165535 deck`

And `lilipod` is ready to use!

## Install Distrobox

Installing distrobox in HOME is quite straightforward:

- Install `distrobox` in your HOME following the `curl` instructions:
  - [INSTALL](../README.md#curl-or-wget)

## Setup ~/.distroboxrc

We need to add some tweaks to our `~/.distroboxrc` to have GUI and Audio working
correctly in SteamOS

Ensure your `~/.distroboxrc` has this content:

```sh
xhost +si:localuser:$USER
export PIPEWIRE_RUNTIME_DIR=/dev/null
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
```

This will force the use of `pulseaudio` inside the container, right now `pipewire`
is not working correctly inside the container, and it's a SteamOS specific issue.

`xhost` is needed to ensure the graphical apps can talk to the Xwayland session.

`PATH` is needed to ensure distrobox can find the `podman` binary we previously
downloaded.

## Start using it

You can now start using `distrobox` on the deck, open the terminal and go:

`distrobox create && distrobox enter`

Refer to the [quickstart guide](../README.md#quick-start) and to the [usage docs](../usage/usage.md)
