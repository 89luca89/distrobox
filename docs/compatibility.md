# Compatibility

This project **does not need a dedicated image**. It can use any OCI images from docker-hub, quay.io, or any registry of your choice.

Granted, they may not be as featureful as expected (some of them do not even have `which`, `mount`, `less` or `vi`)
but that's all doable in the container itself after bootstrapping it.

The main concern is having basic Linux utilities (`mount`), basic user management utilities (`usermod, passwd`), and `sudo` correctly set.

### Supported container managers

`distrobox` can run on either `podman` or `docker`

It depends either on `podman` configured in `rootless mode`
or on `docker` configured without sudo (you're in the `docker` group)

- Minimum podman version: **2.1.0**
- Minimum docker version: **18.06.1**

Follow the official installation guide here:

  - https://podman.io/getting-started/installation
  - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install

### Host Distros

Distrobox has been successfully tested on:

|    Distro  |    Version    | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alpine Linux | 3.14.3 | To setup rootless podman, look [HERE](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Podman) |
| Arch Linux | | To setup rootless podman, look [HERE](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Podman) |
| Manjaro | | To setup rootless podman, look [HERE](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Podman) |
| CentOS | 8<br>8 Stream | Works with corresponding RedHat releases. |
| Debian | 11<br>Testing<br>Unstable | |
| Fedora | 34<br>35 | |
| Fedora Silverblue | 34<br>35 | |
| Gentoo | | To setup rootless podman, look [HERE](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Podman) |
| Ubuntu | 20.04<br>21.10 | Older versions based on 20.04 needs external repos to install newer Podman and Docker releases. <br> Derivatives like Pop_OS!, Mint and Elementary OS should work the same. |
| EndlessOS | 4.0.0 | |
| OpenSUSE | Leap 15<br>Tumbleweed | |
| OpenSUSE MicroOS | 20211209 | |
| NixOS | 21.11 | __NOTE NixOS support is preliminary, and there are many bugs present, any help in improving support is appreciated__ <br> Currently you must have your default shell set to Bash, if it is not, make sure you edit your configuration.nix so that it is. <br> To install distrobox:<br>`mkdir -p ~/.local/bin`<br>Add `PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin` to your bashrc<br>Execute [THIS](#installation) command without sudo.<br>To setup Docker, look [HERE](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Docker) <br>To setup Podman, look [HERE](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Podman) and [HERE](https://gist.github.com/adisbladis/187204cb772800489ee3dac4acdd9947) |
| Void Linux | glibc | Systemd service export will not work.<br>To setup graphical app exporting, you need to install `xhost` and add this to your `~/.xinitrc`: <br> `xhost +si:localuser:$USER`.  |

#### New Host Distro support

If your distro of choice is not on the list, open an issue requesting support for it,
we can work together to check if it is possible to add support for it.

Or just try using it anyway, if it works, open an issue
and it will be added to the list!

Note however that if you use a non-toolbox preconfigured image (e.g. images pre-baked to work with https://github.com/containers/toolbox), the **first** `distrobox-enter` you'll perform
can take a while as it will download and install the missing dependencies.

A small time tax to pay for the ability to use any type of image.
This will **not** occur after the first time, **subsequent enters will be much faster.**

#### New Distro support

If your distro of choice is not on the list, open an issue requesting support for it,
