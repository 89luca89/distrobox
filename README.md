# Distrobox

Use any linux distribution inside your terminal.
Distrobox uses `podman` to create containers using the linux distribution of your choice.
Created container will be tightly integrated with the host, allowing to share
the HOME directory of the user, external storage, external usb devices and
graphical apps (X11/Wayland) and audio.

## What it does

Simply put it's a fancy `podman` wrapper to create and start containers highly integrated with the hosts.

The distrobox environment is based on an OCI image.
This image is used to create a container that seamlessly integrates with the rest of the operating system by providing access to the user's home directory,
the Wayland and X11 sockets, networking, removable devices (like USB sticks), systemd journal, SSH agent, D-Bus,
ulimits, /dev and the udev database, etc..

It implements the same concepts introduced by https://github.com/containers/toolbox but in a simplified way using POSIX sh and aiming at a broader compatibility.

All the props goes to them as they had the great idea to implement this stuff.

It is divided in 4 parts:

- `distrobox-create` - creates the container
- `distrobox-enter`  - to enter the container
- `distrobox-init`   - it's the entrypoint of the container (not meant to be used manually)
- `distrobox-export` - it is meant to be used inside the container, useful to export apps and services from the container to the host

## Why?

- Provide a mutable environment on an immutable OS, like Endless OS, Fedora Silverblue, OpenSUSE MicroOS or SteamOS3
- Provide a locally privileged environment for sudoless setups (eg. company provided laptops, security reasons, etc...)
- To mix and match a stable base system (eg. Debian Stable, Ubuntu LTS, RedHat) with a bleeding edge environment for development or gaming (eg. Arch or OpenSUSE Tumbleweed or Fedora with latest Mesa)
- Leverage high abundance of curated distro images for docker/podman to manage multiple environments

### Aims

This project aims to bring **any distro userland to any other distro** supporting podman.
It has been written in POSIX sh to be as portable as possible and not have problems with glibc version's compatibility.

It also aims to enter the container **as fast as possible**, every millisecond adds up if you use the it
as your default environment for your terminal:

These are some sample results of `distrobox-enter` on the same container on my weak laptop:

```
luca-linux@x250:~$ time distrobox-enter -n fedora-distrobox-35 -- whoami
luca-linux

real    0m0,302s
user    0m0,118s
sys     0m0,095s

luca-linux@x250:~$ time distrobox-enter -n fedora-distrobox-35 -- whoami
luca-linux

real   0m0,281s
user   0m0,116s
sys    0m0,063s

```

I would like to keep it always below the [Doherty Treshold](https://lawsofux.com/doherty-threshold/) of 400ms.

# Compatibility

This project **does not need a dedicated image**. It can use any OCI images from docker-hub, quay.io or any registry of your choice.

Granted, they may not be as featureful as expected (some of them do not even have `which`, `mount`, `less` or `vi`)
but that's all doable in the container itself after bootstrapping it.

Main concern is having basic linux utilities (`mount`), basic user management utilities (`usermod, passwd`) and `sudo` correctly set.

### Host Distros

Distrobox has been successfully tested on:

#### New Host Distro support

If your distro of choice is not in the list open an issue requesting support for it.

Or just try using it anyway, if it works, open an issue
and it will be added to the list!

Note however that if you use a non-toolbox preconfigured image (e.g. images pre-baked to work with https://github.com/containers/toolbox), the **first** `distrobox-enter` you'll perform
can take a while as it will download and install the missing dependencies.

A small time-tax to pay for the ability to use any type of image.
This will **not** occur after the first time, **subsequent enters will be much faster.**

#### New Distro support

If your distro of choice is not in the list open an issue requesting support for it.

Or just try using it anyway, if it works, open an issue
and it will be added to the list!

# Usage

As stated above, there are 4 tools at dispose, 2 have to be used **outside the distrobox (from the host)** and 2 have to be used **inside the distrobox (from the container)**.

## Outside the distrobox

### Create the distrobox

distrobox-create takes care of creating the container with input name and image.
Created container will be tightly integrated with the host, allowing to share
the HOME directory of the user, external storage, external usb devices and
graphical apps (X11/Wayland) and audio.

Usage:

	distrobox-create --image registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora-toolbox:35 --name fedora-toolbox-35

Options:

	--image/-i:		image to use for the container	default: registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora-toolbox:35
	--name/-n:		name for the distrobox		default: fedora-toolbox-35
	--help/-h:		show this message
	--verbose/-v:		show more verbosity
	--version/-V:		show version

### Enter the distrobox

distrobox-enter takes care of entering the container with the name specified.
Default command executed is your SHELL, buf you can specify different shells or
entire commands to execute.

Usage:

	distrobox-enter --name fedora-toolbox-35 -- bash -l

Options:

	--name/-n:		name for the distrobox						default: fedora-toolbox-35
	--/-e:			end arguments execute the rest as command to execute at login	default: bash -l
	--help/-h:		show this message
	--verbose/-v:		show more verbosity
	--version/-V:		show version

This is used to enter the distrobox itself, personally I just create multiple profiles in my `gnome-terminal` to have multiple distros accessible.

## Inside the distrobox

### Application and service exporting

distrobox-export takes care of exporting an app a binary or a service from the container
to the host.

Exported app will be easily available in your normal launcher and it will
automatically be launched from the container it is exported from.

Exported services will be available in the host's user's systemd session, so

	systemctl --user status exported_service_name

will show the status of the service exported.

Exported binaries will be exported in the "--export-path" of choice as a wrapper
script that acts naturally both on the host and in the container.
Note that "--export-path" is NOT OPTIONAL, you have to explicitly set it.

You can specify additional flags to add to the command, for example if you want
to export an electron app, you could add the "--foreground" flag to the command:

	distrobox-export --app atom --extra-flags "--foreground"
	distrobox-export --bin /usr/bin/vim --export-path ~/.local/bin --extra-flags "-p"
	distrobox-export --service syncthing --extra-flags "-allow-newer-config"

This works for services, binaries and apps.
Extra flags are only used then the exported app, binary or service is used from
the host, using them inside the container will not include them.

The option "--delete" will un-export an app, binary or service.

	distrobox-export --app atom --delete
	distrobox-export --bin /usr/bin/vim --export-path ~/.local/bin --delete
	distrobox-export --service syncthing --delete
	distrobox-export --service nginx --delete

The option "--sudo" will launch the exported item as root inside the distrobox.

Note you can use --app OR --bin OR --service but not together.

	distrobox-export --service nginx --sudo

Usage:

	distrobox-export --app mpv [--extra-flags "flags"] [--delete] [--sudo]
	distrobox-export --service syncthing [--extra-flags "flags"] [--delete] [--sudo]
	distrobox-export --bin /path/to/bin --export-path ~/.local/bin [--extra-flags "flags"] [--delete] [--sudo]


Options:

	--app/-a:		name of the application to export
	--bin/-b:		absolute path of the binary to export
	--service/-s:		name of the service to export
	--delete/-d:		delete exported application or service
	--export-path/-ep:	path where to export the binary
	--extra-flags/-ef:	extra flags to add to the command
	--sudo/-S:		specify if the exported item should be ran as sudo
	--help/-h:		show this message
	--verbose/-v:		show more verbosity
	--version/-V:		show version

You may want to install graphical applications or user services in your distrobox.
Using `distrobox-export` from **inside** the container, will let you use them from the host itself.

App export example:

	distrobox-export --app abiword

This tool will simply copy the original `.desktop` files along with needed icons,
add the prefix `/usr/local/bin/distrobox-enter -n distrobox_name -e ... ` to the commands to run, and
save them in your home to be used directly from the host as a normal app.

Service export example:

	distrobox-export --service syncthing --extra-flags "--allow-newer-config"
	distrobox-export --service nginx --sudo

For services, it will similarly export the systemd unit inside the container to an `systemctl --user` service,
prefixing the various `ExecStart ExecStartPre ExecStartPost ExecReload ExecStop ExecStopPost` with the `distrobox-enter` command prefix.

Binary export example:


	distrobox-export --bin /usr/bin/code --extra-flags "--foreground" --export-path $HOME/.local/bin

In case of exporting binaries, you will have to specify **where** to export it (`--export-path`) and the tool will create
a little wrapper script that will `distrobox-enter -e` from the host the desired binary.
This can be handy with the use of `direnv` to have different versions of the same binary based on
your `env` or project.

![app-export](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/598882/144294795-c7785620-bf68-4d1b-b251-1e1f0a32a08d.png)

![service-export](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/598882/144294314-29a8921f-4511-453d-bf8e-d0d1e336db91.png)


NOTE: some electron apps such as vscode and atom need additional flags to work from inside the
container, use the `--extra-flags` option to provide a series of flags, for example:

`distrobox-export --app atom --extra-flags "--foreground"`

#### Init the distrobox

distrobox-init is the entrypoint of a created distrobox.
Note that this HAS to run from inside a distrobox, will not work if you run it
from your host.

distrobox-init will take care of installing missing dependencies (eg. sudo), set
up the user and groups, mount directories from the host to ensure the tight
integration.

Usage:

	distrobox-init --name test-user --user 1000 --group 1000 --home /home/test-user

Options:

	--name/-n:		user name
	--user/-u:		uid of the user
	--group/-g:		gid of the user
	--home/-d:		path/to/home of the user
	--help/-h:		show this message
	--verbose/-v:		show more verbosity
	--version/-V:		show version

This is used as entrypoint for the created container, it will take care of creating the users,
setting up sudo, mountpoints and exports.

**You should not have to launch this manually**

# Installation

If you like to live your life dangerously, you can trust me and simply run this in your terminal:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/89luca89/distrobox/main/install | sudo sh`

or if you want to select a custom directory to install without sudo:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/89luca89/distrobox/main/install | sh -s -- -p ~/.local/bin`

Else you can clone the project using `git clone` or using the `download zip` voice after clicking the green button above.

Enter the directory and run `./install`, by default it will attempt to install in `/usr/local/bin`, you can specify another directory if needed with `./install -p ~/.local/bin`

# Dependencies

It depends on `podman` configured in `rootless mode`

Check out your distro's documentation to check how to.

---

Please be aware that old version of podman (prior to 1.6.4) have an issue with restarting a stopped container, this will create problems to re-enter an already created distrobox.

Follow the official installation guide here: https://podman.io/getting-started/installation

To ensure you have a recent version on your host.

# Useful tips

## Container save and restore

To save, export and reuse an already configured container, you can leverage `podman save` and `podman import`
to basically create snapshots of your environment.

---

To save a container to an image:

```
podman container commit -p distrobox_name image_name_you_choose

podman save image_name_you_choose:latest | gzip > image_name_you_choose.tar.gz
```

This will create a tar.gz of the container of your choice in that exact moment.

---

Now you can backup that archive or transfer it to another host, and to restore it
just run

```
podman import image_name_you_choose.tar.gz
```

And create a new container based on that image:

```
distrobox-create --image image_name_you_choose:latest --name distrobox_name
distrobox-enter --name distrobox_name
```

And you're good to go, now you can reproduce your personal environment everywhere
in simple (and scriptable) steps.

## Check used resources

- You can always check how much space a `distrobox` is taking by using `podman` command:

	`podman system df -v`

- You can check running `distrobox` using:

	`podman ps -a`

- You can remove a `distrobox` using

	`podman rm distrobox_name`

## Using podman inside a distrobox

You can use `podman socket` to control host's podman from inside a `distrobox`,
just use:

`podman --remote`

inside the `distrobox` to use it.

It may be necessary to enable the socket on your host system by using:

`systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket`
