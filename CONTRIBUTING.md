4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPLv3 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPLv3 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project.
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Suggestions
Suggestions are welcome, be sure:

- it is not already being discussed in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues)
    - If it has and is marked as OPEN, go ahead and share your own thoughts about the topic!
    - If it has and is marked as CLOSED, please read the ticket and depending on whether the suggestion was accepted or not consider if it is worth opening a new issue or not.
- Consider if the suggestion is not too out of scope of the project.
- Mark them with a [Suggestion] in the title

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs.
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**A good bug report** should have:

- Check that the bug is not already discussed in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/issues)
- See our [documentation](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/tree/main/docs) if there are some steps that could help you solve your issue
- Mark them with an [Error] in the title
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Provide logs (terminal output, runs with verbose mode)
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- use `shellcheck` to check for posix compliance and bashisms using:
    - `shellcheck -s sh -o all -Cnever -Sstyle -a -f gcc -x`
    - install from: [HERE](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) following [this](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#installing)
- use `shfmt` to style the code using:
    - `shfmt -s`
    - install from [HERE](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) using `go install mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/shfmt@latest`
- Legibility of the code is more important than code golfing, try to be expressive in the code
- Error checking is important! Ensure to LBYL (Look Before You Leap), check for variables and for code success exit codes
- Don't hesitate to comment your code! We're placing high importance on this to maintain the code readable and understandeable
- Update documentation to reflect your changes - Manual pages can be found in directory `docs`

If you are using Visual Studio Code, there are [plugins](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timonwong.shellcheck)  that include all this functionality and throw a warning if you're doing something wrong.
If you are using Vim or Emacs there are plenty of linters and checkers that will integrate with the 2 tools listed above.
